<!--Memories Paragraph-->
<div id="memory">

<p>
Ningbo has wonderful small boutique shopping, mass market crazy shopping, mountain walks, beautiful waterfalls and great seafood places to eat. This city is often overlooked as a tourist destination, due to being known mainly for its industry and as a major port for goods and services coming into China. However it is known for its great Seafood. I remember when I was a child, I would go to a local street called Jin Jia Road that is full of specialty seafood restaurants.
